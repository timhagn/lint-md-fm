# lint-md-fm

**GitHub Action linting markdown &amp; its frontmatter content.**

## Development

This repo has been created with `yarn`.

To be able to test the action also install [`act`](https://github.com/nektos/act).

Further, to publish the action without `node_modules` coming in the way,
install [ncc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vercel/ncc).

To ease formatting, `prettier` is installed and may be called for testing with:

```shell
yarn format
```

and with

```shell
yarn format:fix
```

to automatically fix formatting.

## Info

More info on creating JavaScript GitHub actions may be found on
[GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/creating-a-javascript-action).

## TODO

Adapt this action to one we can use to check the
[ecosystem projects](https://github.com/solana-labs/ecosystem) for:

- [x] project files in a PR not correctly named `{project-name}.md` with `.md` ext
- [x] missing or misnamed logo files
- [x] logo files in the wrong format (not SVG / PNG / JPG)
- [x] (only for bonus-points: image sizes)
- [x] categories not in the `CATEGORY_MAPPING`
- [x] add strict / fuzzy matching for `slug` & `title` duplicate checking
- [x] cleaned up reporting / logging
- [x] adapt this README file to the functionality of the final action

Possible additions:

- [x] add `force-check` option to check all files
- [ ] get `CATEGORY_MAPPING` from solana-com (API call)

Find [`gray-matter`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gray-matter) already
installed to work with Markdown & Frontmatter.
